Original text: kooBobby Joe niisi3ei'i 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): INTERR-Bobby Joe work 
Expected Gloss:INTERR-Bobby Joe work 
 Translation: Is Bobby Joe working ? 

"gloss: INTERR-Bobby Joe work(0.9),
explanation: This sentence consists of three parts:
- 'koo-' is an interrogative prefix (INTERR) used to form questions. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'Bobby Joe' is a proper name, left unglossed. (confidence: 1.0)
- 'niisi3ei'i' is a verb meaning 'work'. (confidence: 0.9)

The sentence \"kooBobby Joe niisi3ei'i\" can be glossed as \"INTERR-Bobby Joe work\", which likely means \"Is Bobby Joe working?\" or \"Does Bobby Joe work?\",

how RAG was used: To generate this explanation, I used the following parts of the given Arapaho grammar document:
- The example in Exercise 5i which shows 'koo-' as an interrogative prefix used to form questions (e.g., 'kooneniibei'ibe' for 'are we singing?').
- The verb 'niisi3ei'i' appears in Exercise 7a as meaning 'work'.
- The structure of the question matches the pattern shown in the examples, where the interrogative prefix is added to the beginning of the sentence.

Confidence scores are high (0.9) for the interrogative prefix and the verb 'work' because they directly match examples in the document. The proper name 'Bobby Joe' is given a confidence of 1.0 as it's clearly a name and doesn't require interpretation based on the grammar."--------------------------------------------------

Original text: A Nih'oo3ousei neneenit 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): A white.woman IC.it.is-3.S 
Expected Gloss:A white.woman IC.it.is-3.S 
 Translation: It is a White Woman . 

"gloss: A white.woman IC-be-3SG,
explanation: This sentence consists of three words:
- 'A' is likely just 'A' (possibly an article or marker, but its function is unclear from the context). (confidence: 1.0)
- 'Nih'oo3ousei' is a noun meaning 'white woman'. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'neneenit' can be broken down as: 'neneeni-' (verb stem meaning 'to be'), '-t' (3rd person singular suffix). The 'IC' (Initial Change) prefix is not visible in the surface form but is indicated in the morpheme breakdown. (confidence: 0.8)

So the whole sentence 'A Nih'oo3ousei neneenit' can be glossed as 'A white.woman IC-be-3SG', which means something like 'A white woman is/exists'.,

how RAG was used: To generate this explanation, I used the following parts of the given Arapaho grammar document:

- The document doesn't provide direct information about 'A' or 'Nih'oo3ousei', so these are interpreted based on the given gloss and general linguistic knowledge.
- The verb form 'neneenit' is similar to other verb forms seen in the document, particularly in Exercise 5i and 5j, where verbs end in '-t' for 3rd person singular.
- The concept of Initial Change (IC) is not explicitly explained in the given context, but it's maintained from the original gloss as it's a common feature in Algonquian languages.
- The general structure of Arapaho verbs with person markers at the end is consistent with examples throughout the document.

Confidence scores were assigned based on how closely each word or morpheme matched information provided in the grammar document or general linguistic knowledge. The lower confidence for the verb breakdown reflects the fact that the exact meaning and structure are inferred rather than explicitly stated in the given context."--------------------------------------------------

The song given above is a very old Tomahawk Society or Club Society Song, written 
down by Natalie Curtis in the early 1900s. Notice that the song is all about “I”, and notice 
also that virtually every word ends with -noo. Based on this pattern,  you can figure out 
that when a person is talking about themself in Arapaho, the verb will end with -noo. You 
can also see that Arapaho words usually have at least two parts: a “general meaning” and 
an ending to make the meaning more specific. Above, nenee ni- means ‘it is’ and the final 
-noo makes the word mean ‘it is I’ or just ‘I’ for short. The verb nonookuni3ee - means 
‘have a white horn’ so the ending makes the whole word mean ‘I have a white horn.’  
  In this chapter, we show how to talk about things in cluding a meaning of "you" 
 and "I".

Original text: Wohei hei'iini 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): okay when.PERF-DETACH 
Expected Gloss:okay when.PERF-DETACH 
 Translation: Well when the moment came , 

"gloss: okay when.PERF-DETACH(?),

explanation: This sentence consists of two words:
- 'Wohei' is an interjection meaning 'okay'. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'hei'iini' can be broken down as:
  - 'hei'i-' (verb root meaning 'when' in the perfective aspect)
  - '-ini' (suffix, possibly meaning 'detach' or indicating some kind of separation, but its exact function is unclear) (confidence: 0.7)

The overall meaning seems to be something like \"Okay, when [something] detached/separated\", but the exact meaning of the '-ini' suffix is uncertain.

how RAG was used: To generate this explanation, I used the following information from the provided context:

1. The context doesn't provide direct information about the specific words in this sentence.
2. However, the dialogue examples in the context show that 'Tous' is used as a greeting, which suggests that 'Wohei' might serve a similar function as an interjection.
3. The context doesn't provide specific information about the 'hei'i-' root or the '-ini' suffix.
4. The perfective aspect is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but the use of tense/aspect markers is implied in the various verb forms discussed.

Given the limited direct relevance of the provided context to this specific sentence, the glossing relies more on inference and general linguistic knowledge. The confidence in the gloss for 'hei'iini' is lower due to the lack of specific information about this morpheme in the provided context. The '?' in the gloss for 'DETACH' indicates uncertainty about this particular morpheme's function."--------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER TWO - AI VERBS  
 
 We will begin by learning a few common Arapaho verbs in addition  to those from the 
preceding chapter:  
 
 nííhonéíhinoo   I am yellow  
 henííyootéíhinoo     I am clean  
 tenéi'éíhinoo   I am strong  
 bee'éíhinoo   I am red  
 
 These verbs are all intransitive  - they have a subject  but no object . For the moment, let's 
limit ourse lves to animate (living) subjects. (Arapaho makes an important distinction between 
animate and inanimate things, in both its nouns and its verbs, but we will save discussion of this 
for later). Arapaho indicates the subject of the verb by adding suffixes  to the end of the verb. The 
suffixes are as follows:  
 
  1st person(1)   -noo  "I" 
  2nd person(2)   -n  "you"  
  3rd person(3)   -t  "he" or "she"  
  1plural(1p)   -'  "we"  
     -ni’  same as above  
  12   -no'  "we" (you and me)  
  2plural(2p)   -nee  "you two (or more)"  
  3plural(3p)   -3i'  "they"  
 
 From now on, we will use the abbreviations 1p, 2p and so forth to save space when 
talking about the verbs.  
 Thus, using tenei'eihi - ("strong"), we have:  
 
  tenéi'éíhinoo   I am strong  
  tenéi'éíhin   you are strong  
  tenéi'éíhit   he/she is strong  
 
  tenéí'eihí'   we are strong  
  tenéí'eihíno'   we are strong  
  tenéí'eihínee   you two are strong  
  tenéí'eihí3i'   they are strong  
 
 STRESS:  
 In many cases, the final -i of tenei'eihi - is dropped before the endings -noo, -n, and -t. 
This is virtually always true before -t. So Arapaho speakers normally say tenei'éíht.  
 In the plural forms, the stress typically shifts "forward" towards the end of the word, as in 
the above examples. The final -eihí3i' may be pronounced -ehí3i' or -ehéí3i' on some occasions.

CHAPTER 26 - PASSIVES  
 
 If we want to say in Arapaho that "I am seen" as opposed to seeing someone else, we can 
combine the TA verb forms and an AI verb ending. Study the following:  
 
 nonóóhobéíhinoo  
 
This word is made up of nonoohob - (to see someone), -eihi- (the same ending w e saw on "I am 
strong, I am red," etc), and -noo, meaning I. Other examples are:  
 
 henééteenebé3en  I respect you  
 henééteenebéíhinoo  I am respected  
 henééteenebéíht  He is respected

 Translation: My older brother , \ 'ecwell here we're going to ride down stream ,\ 'ee he said . 

"gloss: 1S-older.brother okay 3S FUT-ride.downstream-1PL.INCL he,
explanation: This sentence consists of six words:
- 'Neeseh'e' can be broken down as 'ne-' (1st person singular prefix, 1S) and 'eseh'e' (meaning 'older brother'). (confidence: 0.9)
- 'wohei' is glossed as 'okay', which seems to be an interjection or adverb. (confidence: 0.8)
- 'huut' is glossed as '3S', likely representing a 3rd person singular pronoun. (confidence: 0.8)
- 'heetoowuniihiikoheino'' can be broken down as 'heet-' (future tense prefix, FUT), 'oowuniihiikohei' (verb root meaning 'ride downstream'), and '-no'' (1st person plural inclusive suffix, 1PL.INCL). (confidence: 0.9)
- 'nih'iit' is glossed as 'he', which is likely a 3rd person singular pronoun. (confidence: 0.8)

The whole sentence 'Neeseh'e wohei huut heetoowuniihiikoheino' nih'iit' can be glossed as '1S-older.brother okay 3S FUT-ride.downstream-1PL.INCL he', which means something like 'My older brother, okay, he will ride downstream with us'.

how RAG was used: To generate this explanation, I used the following parts of the given Arapaho grammar document:
- The context provided does not directly address the specific morphemes in this sentence. However, the general structure of Arapaho verbs with prefixes and suffixes is evident in the examples given in the document.
- The future tense prefix 'heet-' is consistent with the mention of future tense in Exercise 19d.
- The 1st person plural inclusive suffix '-no'' is inferred from the context of other person markers mentioned in the document.
- The use of pronouns and person markers is consistent with the general grammatical structure described in the document.

Confidence scores were assigned based on how closely each word or morpheme matched information provided in the grammar document or could be inferred from general Arapaho grammatical patterns. Higher scores (closer to 0.9) indicate a stronger match or inference, while lower scores (closer to 0.8) indicate a more tentative interpretation based on context."--------------------------------------------------

Original text: Biihouut neneenit: 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): cricket IC.it.is-3.S 
Expected Gloss:cricket IC.it.is-3.S 
 Translation: It's a cricket : 

"gloss: cricket IC.be-3SG,
explanation: This sentence consists of two words:
- 'Biihouut' is a noun meaning 'cricket'. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'neneenit' can be broken down as:
  'neneeni-' (verb stem meaning 'to be', specifically an Initiate Change form)
  '-t' (3rd person singular suffix). (confidence: 0.8)

So the whole sentence 'Biihouut neneenit' can be glossed as 'cricket IC.be-3SG', which means \"It is a cricket\" or \"There is a cricket\".

how RAG was used: To generate this explanation, I used the following information from the provided context:
- The document doesn't specifically mention 'biihouut' or 'cricket', but as it's presented as a noun without further breakdown, I've maintained its gloss.
- The verb form 'neneeni-' is not explicitly explained, but the use of 'IC' (Initiate Change) is consistent with Arapaho verbal morphology as seen in other examples.
- The '-t' suffix for 3rd person singular is consistent with other verb conjugations seen in the examples, such as in \"Beet e'enee\" and \"Beet e'eni'\".

The confidence scores reflect the degree of certainty based on the information available in the context. The noun 'biihouut' is given a high confidence as it's presented without decomposition. The verb form is given a slightly lower confidence as its exact form is not explicitly explained in the provided context, but its structure is consistent with Arapaho verbal morphology as seen in the examples."--------------------------------------------------

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): also IC.be.many-3PL this IC.young.generation-3PL 3.IMPERF.NEG-speak.Arapaho-look.like.a.captive 
Expected Gloss:also IC.be.many-3PL this IC.young.generation-3PL 3.IMPERF.NEG-speak.Arapaho-pers.PL 
 Translation: Also there are many of the younger generation , They don't speak Arapaho . 

"gloss: also IC.be.many-3PL this IC.young.generation-3PL 3.IMPERF.NEG-speak.Arapaho-PL,
explanation: This sentence consists of six words or morphemes:

1. \"howoo\" is glossed as \"also\", which seems correct based on context. (confidence: 0.9)

2. \"wonoo3ee-3i'\" is glossed as \"IC.be.many-3PL\". The \"-3i'\" suffix indicating 3rd person plural seems correct. \"wonoo3ee\" is likely an initial change form of a verb meaning \"to be many\". (confidence: 0.8)

3. \"nuhu'\" is glossed as \"this\", which seems correct based on context. (confidence: 0.9)

4. \"wonooniii'oo-3i'\" is glossed as \"IC.young.generation-3PL\". The \"-3i'\" suffix is again 3rd person plural. \"wonooniii'oo\" appears to be an initial change form referring to the young generation. (confidence: 0.8)

5. \"hiihoowu-\" is glossed as \"3.IMPERF.NEG-\", which seems to be a correct prefix for 3rd person imperfective negative. (confidence: 0.9)

6. \"unono'eiti-no'\" is glossed as \"speak.Arapaho-PL\". The \"-no'\" suffix is changed to \"-PL\" as it likely indicates plural. \"unono'eiti\" seems to mean \"speak Arapaho\". (confidence: 0.8)

The overall meaning appears to be \"Also, there are many of this young generation who do not speak Arapaho.\"

how RAG was used: The grammar document was used in the following ways:

1. The document mentions \"3i'\" as a common ending, which supports the 3PL interpretation in \"wonoo3ee-3i'\" and \"wonooniii'oo-3i'\".

2. The document discusses initial change forms, which supports the \"IC\" interpretation for \"wonoo3ee\" and \"wonooniii'oo\".

3. The prefix \"hiihoowu-\" is consistent with the negative forms mentioned in the document, supporting the 3.IMPERF.NEG interpretation.

4. The document mentions \"-no'\" as a common ending, which supports changing it to a more general \"PL\" gloss.

5. The document doesn't provide specific information about \"unono'eiti\", but the context and the presence of \"Arapaho\" in the gloss support its interpretation as \"speak Arapaho\".

The confidence scores reflect the degree of support from the grammar document, with higher scores for elements directly mentioned or strongly supported by the document, and lower scores for elements inferred from context or partial matches."--------------------------------------------------

I am White Horn

The song given above is a very old Tomahawk Society or Club Society Song, written 
down by Natalie Curtis in the early 1900s. Notice that the song is all about “I”, and notice 
also that virtually every word ends with -noo. Based on this pattern,  you can figure out 
that when a person is talking about themself in Arapaho, the verb will end with -noo. You 
can also see that Arapaho words usually have at least two parts: a “general meaning” and 
an ending to make the meaning more specific. Above, nenee ni- means ‘it is’ and the final 
-noo makes the word mean ‘it is I’ or just ‘I’ for short. The verb nonookuni3ee - means 
‘have a white horn’ so the ending makes the whole word mean ‘I have a white horn.’  
  In this chapter, we show how to talk about things in cluding a meaning of "you" 
 and "I".

 You should begin by memorizing the following. These expressions allow for basic 
conversational greetings, and also include words th at will allow students to say in Arapaho that 
they don't understand things in class, need things repeated, and so forth.

 Arapaho is a member of a group of languages called the Algonquian languages. It is 
related to Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Gros Ventre, and many languages spoken in t he northeastern US 
and Canada: Cree, Ojibwa, Micmac, Shawnee, Kickapoo and others. Many of the English words 
borrowed from Indian languages come from these Algonquian languages - canoe, wigwam, 
moose, wampum, moccasin, etc.

Original text: 'oh hiwoxtootino 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): but 3S-sins,.bad.deeds 
Expected Gloss:but 3S-sins,.bad.deeds 
 Translation: but rather his sins . 

"Based on the provided context and the example, I'll correct the gloss line and provide an explanation:

gloss: but 3S-sin.bad.deeds,

explanation: This sentence consists of two words:
- ''oh' is a conjunction meaning 'but'. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'hiwoxtootino' can be broken down as:
  - 'hi-' (3rd person singular prefix, 3S) (confidence: 0.9)
  - 'woxtootino' (verb meaning 'sin' or 'do bad deeds') (confidence: 0.8)

The whole phrase ''oh hiwoxtootino' can be glossed as 'but 3S-sin.bad.deeds', which means something like 'but he/she sins' or 'but he/she does bad deeds'.

how RAG was used: To generate this explanation, I used the following parts of the given Arapaho grammar document:
- The document mentions third-person singular (3SING) forms, which supports the interpretation of 'hi-' as a 3rd person singular prefix.
- While the exact verb 'woxtootino' is not present in the provided context, the document discusses various verb forms and their prefixes, which helps in understanding the structure of the verb.
- The conjunction ''oh' is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it's a common word in many languages meaning 'but', and its use here is consistent with that meaning.

The confidence scores are based on how closely each element matches information in the grammar document. The 3S prefix is given a high confidence (0.9) because third-person singular forms are explicitly discussed in the document. The verb root is given a slightly lower confidence (0.8) because while its structure is consistent with Arapaho verbs described in the document, the specific verb is not present in the given context."--------------------------------------------------

Original text: And the other one would say hee hii3eti' 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): and the other one would say yes wander.around-0S 
Expected Gloss:and the other one would say yes IC.good-0S 
 Translation: And the other one would say , yes , it's good . 

"gloss: and the other one would say yes wander.around-3S,

explanation: This sentence consists of six words:
- 'And' is a conjunction, correctly glossed as 'and'. (confidence: 1.0)
- 'the' is an article, correctly glossed as 'the'. (confidence: 1.0)
- 'other' is an adjective, correctly glossed as 'other'. (confidence: 1.0)
- 'one' is a pronoun, correctly glossed as 'one'. (confidence: 1.0)
- 'would say' is a verbal phrase, correctly glossed as 'would say'. (confidence: 1.0)
- 'hee' is likely an interjection meaning 'yes', correctly glossed. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'hii3eti'' can be broken down as:
  - 'hii3eti-' (verb root meaning 'to wander around')
  - '-'' (3rd person singular suffix, changed from '0S' to '3S') (confidence: 0.8)

how RAG was used: The RAG context provided did not contain specific information about the glossing of this sentence. However, based on the general patterns observed in Arapaho verbs from the context, I made the following inferences:

1. The verb 'hii3eti'' appears to be an AI (Animate Intransitive) verb, as it describes an action performed by an animate subject.
2. The '-'' suffix at the end of 'hii3eti'' is likely a person marker. In Arapaho, '-'' often indicates a 3rd person singular form for AI verbs.
3. The gloss '0S' (zero suffix) was changed to '3S' (3rd person singular) to more accurately reflect the likely meaning of the suffix.

The rest of the sentence was already correctly glossed in English, so no changes were made to those parts. The confidence for most of the gloss is high (1.0) as these are common English words. The confidence for 'hee' and the verb suffix is slightly lower (0.9 and 0.8 respectively) as these are inferences based on typical Arapaho patterns rather than direct information from the provided context."--------------------------------------------------

 We've already seen that nouns can be made into verbs, and verbs into nouns, in Arapaho. 
There are also ways to make one type of verb into another type. We'll just look at one of these

Original text: booboo3eti3i' ci' 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): REDUP-fight.each.other-3PL too 
Expected Gloss:REDUP-fight.each.other-3PL too 
 Translation: They were fighting with each other too . 

"gloss: REDUP-fight.each.other-3PL also,
explanation: This sentence consists of two words:
- 'booboo3eti3i'' can be broken down as:
  'boo-' (reduplication prefix, REDUP)
  'boo3eti' (verb root meaning 'fight each other')
  '-3i'' (3rd person plural suffix, 3PL)
- 'ci'' is a particle meaning 'also' or 'too'

The whole phrase \"booboo3eti3i' ci'\" can be glossed as \"REDUP-fight.each.other-3PL also\", which means something like \"They are also fighting each other repeatedly\" or \"They, too, are engaged in a back-and-forth fight\".

how RAG was used: The grammar document provided doesn't directly address this specific sentence or its components. However, I used general linguistic knowledge to interpret the glossing:

1. The reduplication (REDUP) is a common feature in many languages to indicate repetition or intensity of an action.
2. The '-3i'' suffix is consistent with 3rd person plural marking in many languages.
3. The verb 'boo3eti' is interpreted as 'fight each other' based on the given gloss.
4. The particle 'ci'' is glossed as 'too', which is consistent with its common usage in many languages.

Since the RAG doesn't provide specific information about these morphemes in Arapaho, the glossing is maintained as it appears to be linguistically plausible. If more specific Arapaho grammar information were available, it could potentially refine this analysis."--------------------------------------------------

 nonooh - and the -oot and -ob are endings unique to TI and TA verbs. This is very simi lar to the 
difference between niihoo -yoo- and niihoo -neihi -, where the same root forms two different verb 
stems by the addition of two different endings prior to the final pronouns. The opposition of -oot 
and -ob (and variations) is very common in Arapaho with many different verbs. For example:

Original text: who is this nih'iit 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): whose is this he 
Expected Gloss:whose is this he 
 Translation: " Whose is this ?" he said . 

"gloss: whose(0.9) is(0.9) this(0.9) 3S(0.8),

explanation: This sentence consists of four words:
- 'whose' is correctly glossed and matches the Arapaho word 'nih'iit' (confidence: 0.9)
- 'is' is correctly glossed as a copula verb (confidence: 0.9)
- 'this' is correctly glossed as a demonstrative pronoun (confidence: 0.9)
- 'he' has been replaced with '3S' for third-person singular, which is more likely in interlinear glossing (confidence: 0.8)

how RAG was used: The grammar document provided doesn't directly address this specific sentence or these exact words. However, it does give context for Arapaho sentence structure and some common words. The correction from 'he' to '3S' is based on general linguistic glossing conventions, as '3S' is a more standard way to represent third-person singular in interlinear glosses. The rest of the gloss remains unchanged as it appears to be correct and consistent with English translations of similar Arapaho phrases seen in the document. The confidence levels are relatively high due to the simplicity of the sentence and the clear correspondence between the Arapaho words and their English translations."--------------------------------------------------

I am White Horn  
I am Whirlwind Passing By  
I am ag ain alive.  
 
The song given above is a very old Tomahawk Society or Club Society Song, written 
down by Natalie Curtis in the early 1900s. Notice that the song is all about “I”, and notice 
also that virtually every word ends with -noo. Based on this pattern,  you can figure out 
that when a person is talking about themself in Arapaho, the verb will end with -noo. You 
can also see that Arapaho words usually have at least two parts: a “general meaning” and 
an ending to make the meaning more specific. Above, nenee ni- means ‘it is’ and the final 
-noo makes the word mean ‘it is I’ or just ‘I’ for short. The verb nonookuni3ee - means 
‘have a white horn’ so the ending makes the whole word mean ‘I have a white horn.’  
  In this chapter, we show how to talk about things in cluding a meaning of "you" 
 and "I".

Original text: Kookoniini hoonowouunonou'u 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): just.any-DETACH REDUP-take.pity.on-say 
Expected Gloss:just.any-DETACH REDUP-take.pity.on-1S 
 Translation: I just pity them . 

"gloss: just.any-DETACH REDUP-take.pity.on-3PL.INAN(?),
explanation: This sentence consists of two words:

1. \"Kookoniini\" is composed of:
   - \"kookoni-\" meaning \"just any\" or \"any kind of\" (confidence: 0.9)
   - \"-ini\" which appears to be a detachable suffix (DETACH) (confidence: 0.8)

2. \"hoonowouunonou'u\" can be broken down as:
   - \"hoon-\" is a reduplication prefix (REDUP) (confidence: 0.9)
   - \"owouunon-\" is likely the verb root meaning \"take pity on\" (confidence: 0.8)
   - \"-ou'u\" is possibly a 3rd person plural inanimate suffix, though this is less certain (confidence: 0.6)

The overall meaning seems to be something like \"Just any (kind of) repeated taking pity on them (inanimate objects)\".

how RAG was used: The grammar document provided didn't contain direct information about the specific morphemes in this sentence. However, it did offer some insights:

1. The document mentions reduplication in Arapaho verbs, which supports the interpretation of \"hoon-\" as a reduplication prefix.
2. The document shows examples of complex verb forms with prefixes and suffixes, which aligns with the structure we see in \"hoonowouunonou'u\".
3. While the specific suffixes \"-ini\" and \"-ou'u\" are not explained in the given context, the general structure of Arapaho verbs with multiple affixes is consistent with what we see in this example.

The lack of specific information about these morphemes in the provided context led to some uncertainty, particularly for the \"-ou'u\" suffix. The gloss was maintained mostly as given, with the addition of a question mark for the less certain \"3PL.INAN\" interpretation of \"-ou'u\"."--------------------------------------------------

Original text: Kookon nooxeihi' niibi'eeneiwooku'oot 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): just.any maybe children-just-peek,.sneak.glances-3.S 
Expected Gloss:just.any maybe IMPERF-just-peek,.sneak.glances-3.S 
 Translation: Maybe he is just peeking at things  [ on the paper ] [ so he'll know the words ]. 

"gloss: just.any maybe 3S-just-peek.sneak.glances-3S,

explanation: This sentence consists of four words/morphemes:

- 'kookon' is glossed as 'just.any', which seems to be an adverb or particle indicating uncertainty or generality. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'nooxeihi'' is glossed as 'maybe', another adverb indicating possibility. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'nii-' is a prefix that seems to indicate 3rd person singular (3S). It was initially glossed as 'children-' but this doesn't fit the context. (confidence: 0.8)
- 'bi'-' is glossed as 'just', which appears to be a adverbial or modal prefix. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'eeneiwooku'oo-' is the verb stem meaning 'peek, sneak glances'. (confidence: 0.9)
- '-t' is a suffix indicating 3rd person singular (3S) subject. (confidence: 0.9)

The whole sentence \"Kookon nooxeihi' niibi'eeneiwooku'oot\" can be glossed as \"just.any maybe 3S-just-peek.sneak.glances-3S\", which means something like \"Just anyone might be peeking/sneaking glances\".

how RAG was used: To generate this explanation, I used the following parts of the given Arapaho grammar document:

- The document doesn't explicitly mention 'kookon' or 'nooxeihi'', but their glosses seem consistent with adverbial particles in Arapaho.
- The prefix 'nii-' is inferred to be a 3rd person marker based on the context and the presence of the '-t' suffix, which is commonly used for 3rd person singular in Arapaho verbs.
- The 'bi'-' prefix is consistent with other examples in Arapaho where prefixes modify the verb meaning.
- The verb stem 'eeneiwooku'oo-' is treated as a single unit, as is common in Arapaho verbs.
- The '-t' suffix is consistently used in the examples to indicate 3rd person singular subjects.

The correction from 'children-' to '3S-' for the 'nii-' prefix was made based on the overall sentence structure and the presence of the 3S suffix '-t', which suggests that the subject is singular, not plural. The document doesn't provide explicit information about this prefix, so the interpretation is based on the context and general understanding of Arapaho verb structure."--------------------------------------------------

 Again, as normally, these verbs can be used for questions and "no" responses, with the 
suffixes being replaced by prefixes . The system works almost exactly like for AI verbs, except 
that the special negative suffixes are different when more than one person is being talked about.

Original text: ne'eeneiP beh'eihehi' henee3neeni'i3ecoohoono' 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): that-what-this old.man IC.very-make.happy-12 
Expected Gloss:that-what-pause old.man IC.very-make.happy-12 
 Translation: This is how we make the Old Man  [ sacred flat pipe ] very happy . 

"gloss: that-what-? old.man IC.very-make.happy-1PL.INCL,

explanation: This sentence consists of three main parts:

1. \"ne'eeneiP\" is glossed as \"that-what-?\":
   - \"ne'\" is likely a demonstrative meaning \"that\" (confidence: 0.9)
   - \"eeneis\" seems to mean \"what\" (confidence: 0.8)
   - The final \"P\" is unclear and replaced with \"?\" (confidence: 0.5)

2. \"beh'eihehi'\" is glossed as \"old.man\" (confidence: 0.9)

3. \"henee3neeni'i3ecoohoono'\" is broken down as:
   - \"henee3nee-\" is glossed as \"IC.very-\", likely an intensifier (confidence: 0.8)
   - \"ni'i3ecooh-\" means \"make.happy\" (confidence: 0.9)
   - \"-oono'\" is corrected to \"1PL.INCL\" for first person plural inclusive (confidence: 0.9)

how RAG was used: The grammar document was used in the following ways:

1. The document doesn't provide direct information about \"ne'eeneiP\", but the demonstrative \"ne'\" is common in Arapaho.

2. \"beh'eihehi'\" is not directly mentioned, but it's consistent with noun forms in the examples.

3. The verb form \"ni'i3ecoo\" meaning \"happy\" is found in the document (Exercise 5j), supporting the \"make.happy\" gloss.

4. The ending \"-oono'\" is corrected based on the document's examples of first person plural forms, such as \"neniibei'ino'\" ('we are singing') in Exercise 5i.

5. The \"IC\" (Initial Change) prefix \"henee3nee-\" is inferred from similar prefixes in the document, though its exact meaning is not explicitly stated.

The confidence scores reflect how closely each gloss matches information in the grammar document or how confidently it can be inferred from the context and examples provided."--------------------------------------------------

Original text: cihce'etisee nihneenii3owoon 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): 3.S-back-come.out.of.container PAST-look.like.a.captive-2S 
Expected Gloss:to.here-back-come.out.of.container PAST-look.like.a.captive-2S 
 Translation: Come back out of there , you look like a captive . 

"gloss: 3S-back-come.out.of.container PAST-look.like.a.captive-2S,
explanation: This sentence consists of two complex words:

1. \"cihce'etisee\":
   - \"cih-\" is a 3rd person singular prefix (3S) (confidence: 0.9)
   - \"ce'-\" likely means \"back\" or \"return\" (confidence: 0.8)
   - \"etisee\" appears to be a verb meaning \"come out of container\" (confidence: 0.7)

2. \"nihneenii3owoon\":
   - \"nih-\" is a past tense marker (PAST) (confidence: 0.9)
   - \"neenii3owoo\" seems to be a verb meaning \"look like a captive\" (confidence: 0.7)
   - \"-n\" is a 2nd person singular suffix (2S) (confidence: 0.9)

The overall meaning seems to be \"He/she came back out (of something) and you looked like a captive.\",

how RAG was used: The grammar document was used in the following ways:

1. The document doesn't directly address the specific morphemes in this sentence, but it provides context for Arapaho verb structure and prefixes/suffixes.

2. The 3rd person singular prefix \"cih-\" and 2nd person singular suffix \"-n\" are consistent with person markers mentioned in various examples throughout the document.

3. The past tense marker \"nih-\" is consistent with the use of prefixes for tense marking in Arapaho, as seen in various examples in the document.

4. The complex verb structures with multiple morphemes (prefixes, roots, and suffixes) are typical of Arapaho, as demonstrated in numerous examples in the document.

5. The document doesn't provide specific information about the meanings of \"ce'etisee\" or \"neenii3owoo\", so these are inferred based on the overall structure and context.

The confidence levels reflect the degree of certainty based on the information available in the grammar document and general linguistic knowledge. Higher confidence is given to person and tense markers, which are more consistently used across examples in the document."--------------------------------------------------

Original text: nooxeihi' niinookoniinisee3i' 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): maybe IMPERF-Bobby-wander.around-3PL 
Expected Gloss:maybe IMPERF-until.morning-wander.around-3PL 
 Translation: Maybe they walk around all night . 

"gloss: maybe PERF-?-wander.around-3PL,
explanation: This sentence consists of four morphemes:

- 'nooxeihi'' is a standalone word meaning \"maybe\" or \"perhaps\". (confidence: 0.9)
- 'nii-' is a perfective aspect marker (PERF). (confidence: 0.8)
- 'nookon-' is likely a proper name or a noun, possibly \"Bobby\", but I'm not certain. I've marked it with a '?' as I can't confirm this from the given context. (confidence: 0.6)
- 'iinisee' is the verb root meaning \"to wander around\". (confidence: 0.9)
- '-3i'' is a third person plural (3PL) marker. (confidence: 0.9)

The whole phrase \"nooxeihi' niinookoniinisee3i'\" can be glossed as \"maybe PERF-?-wander.around-3PL\", which roughly translates to \"Maybe they (have) wandered around\".

how RAG was used: To generate this explanation, I used the following parts of the given Arapaho grammar document:

- The document doesn't explicitly mention 'nooxeihi'', but based on its position and the gloss provided, it's likely an adverb meaning \"maybe\".
- The prefix 'nii-' is not explicitly explained in the given context, but based on its position and common linguistic patterns, it's likely a perfective aspect marker.
- The document doesn't provide information about 'nookon', so I've marked it as uncertain.
- The verb structure with prefixes and suffixes is consistent with the patterns shown in the document, particularly in the section discussing verb forms and person markers.
- The '-3i'' suffix is consistently used in the document to indicate third person plural, which aligns with the gloss provided.

The confidence scores are based on how closely each morpheme matches information in the grammar document or common linguistic patterns. The lower confidence for 'nookon-' reflects the lack of specific information about this morpheme in the provided context."--------------------------------------------------

I am White Horn  
I am Whirlwind Passing By  
I am ag ain alive.  
 
The song given above is a very old Tomahawk Society or Club Society Song, written 
down by Natalie Curtis in the early 1900s. Notice that the song is all about “I”, and notice 
also that virtually every word ends with -noo. Based on this pattern,  you can figure out 
that when a person is talking about themself in Arapaho, the verb will end with -noo. You 
can also see that Arapaho words usually have at least two parts: a “general meaning” and 
an ending to make the meaning more specific. Above, nenee ni- means ‘it is’ and the final 
-noo makes the word mean ‘it is I’ or just ‘I’ for short. The verb nonookuni3ee - means 
‘have a white horn’ so the ending makes the whole word mean ‘I have a white horn.’  
  In this chapter, we show how to talk about things in cluding a meaning of "you" 
 and "I".

Expected Gloss:when.PERF-DETACH when.PERF-pause when.PERF-finish-3.S but then-pause then-REDUP-carve-3S here.it.is this stick 
 Translation: When , when she was done , then she carved this stick . 

"gloss: when.PERF-DETACH(?) when.PERF-pause(?) when.PERF-finish-3S then then-pause then-REDUP-carve-3S FUT other stick,

explanation: This sentence consists of several words and morphemes:

- 'hei'iini': Appears to be a temporal marker, glossed as 'when.PERF-DETACH'. The 'when.PERF' part seems correct, but 'DETACH' is unclear and marked with (?). (confidence: 0.7)
- 'hei'P': Glossed as 'when.PERF-pause', but 'pause' is unclear and marked with (?). (confidence: 0.6)
- 'hei'bee3toot': Correctly glossed as 'when.PERF-finish-3S'. (confidence: 0.9)
- ''oh': Correctly glossed as 'then'. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'ne'P': Glossed as 'then-pause', but 'pause' is unclear and marked with (?). (confidence: 0.6)
- 'ne'neenii3oxo'': Correctly glossed as 'then-REDUP-carve-3S'. (confidence: 0.8)
- 'niiyou': Correctly glossed as 'FUT' (future). (confidence: 0.9)
- 'nuh'uuno': Correctly glossed as 'other'. (confidence: 0.9)
- 'bes': Correctly glossed as 'stick'. (confidence: 0.9)

The overall meaning seems to be describing a sequence of actions related to carving a stick, with temporal and aspectual markers.

how RAG was used: The grammar document provided limited direct information for this specific gloss. However, it was used in the following ways:

1. The document mentions prefixes and suffixes in Arapaho, which supports the morpheme breakdown in the gloss.
2. The presence of third-person singular markers (-t, -o') in the grammar aligns with the '3S' glosses in the sentence.
3. The document discusses the use of reduplicated forms, which supports the 'REDUP' gloss for 'neenii3oxo''.
4. The future tense marker 'niiyou' is consistent with the tense markers mentioned in the grammar.
5. The grammar doesn't provide specific information about the 'hei'' and 'ne'' prefixes or their glosses, which is why they are marked with (?).

The confidence scores reflect the degree of support found in the grammar document, with higher scores for elements that are more clearly supported or common across languages, and lower scores for elements that are less certain or not directly addressed in the provided context."--------------------------------------------------

Original text: nohuusoho' 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): like.that 
Expected Gloss:like.that 
 Translation: That's it . 

"gloss: like.that(?),
explanation: The sentence consists of one word:
- 'nohuusoho'' appears to be a single morpheme. Based on the gloss provided, it means \"like that\" or \"in that way\". However, without more context from the Arapaho grammar, it's difficult to determine if this gloss is entirely accurate or if the word can be further segmented. (confidence: 0.7)

how RAG was used: Unfortunately, the provided Arapaho grammar context does not contain any direct information about the word 'nohuusoho'' or its meaning. The context mainly focuses on verb conjugations, question formations, and a simplified story in Arapaho. Without specific information about this word or similar constructions, it's challenging to confirm or correct the given gloss with high confidence. The gloss \"like that\" is maintained as it was provided, but marked with a question mark to indicate uncertainty due to lack of supporting information in the given context."--------------------------------------------------

 nonooh - and the -oot and -ob are endings unique to TI and TA verbs. This is very simi lar to the 
difference between niihoo -yoo- and niihoo -neihi -, where the same root forms two different verb 
stems by the addition of two different endings prior to the final pronouns. The opposition of -oot 
and -ob (and variations) is very common in Arapaho with many different verbs. For example:

Original text: Heisonoonin heetih'owouunoneinee 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): 2S.IMPERF-father-12POSS so.that-IMPERF-3 
Expected Gloss:2S.IMPERF-father-12POSS so.that-take.pity.on-3 
 Translation: Our father , we ask that he take pity on you . 

"gloss: 2S-father-12POSS so.that-?-3S,
explanation: This sentence consists of two main parts:

1. \"Heisonoonin\":
   - \"he-\" is the 2nd person singular prefix (2S)
   - \"isonoon\" is the root meaning \"father\"
   - \"-in\" is the 1st person inclusive plural possessive suffix (12POSS)

2. \"heetih'owouunoneinee\":
   - \"heetih\" is a conjunction meaning \"so that\"
   - \"'owouunon\" is unclear from the context (marked with ?)
   - \"-einee\" appears to be a 3rd person singular suffix (3S)

The overall meaning seems to be \"Your (singular) our (inclusive) father so that he/she [does something]\",

how RAG was used: The grammar document was used in the following ways:

1. The document doesn't explicitly mention the prefixes and suffixes used in this example. However, based on the general patterns of Arapaho verb morphology shown in other examples, we can infer the person markers.

2. The document shows examples of other verbs with similar structures, which helped in identifying the 2nd person singular prefix \"he-\" and the 3rd person singular suffix \"-einee\".

3. The possessive suffix \"-in\" for 1st person inclusive plural (our) is not explicitly mentioned, but it's consistent with the patterns seen in other Arapaho examples.

4. The conjunction \"heetih\" (so that) is not directly mentioned in the provided context, but it's treated as a known word based on its position and function in the sentence.

5. The middle part of the second word \"'owouunon\" is unclear and couldn't be confidently glossed based on the available information, hence it's marked with a question mark.

The RAG was helpful in providing a general understanding of Arapaho morphology and sentence structure, but it didn't provide specific information about all the morphemes in this particular example. Therefore, some parts of the gloss are based on inference and pattern recognition rather than direct information from the grammar document."--------------------------------------------------

Original text: tei'yoonoh'o' niibiseentoot niiyou beh'eihoho' 

Model output (or obfuscated gloss): children IMPERF-appear-be.at-3.S 12 old.men 
Expected Gloss:children IMPERF-appear-be.at-3.S here.it.is old.men 
 Translation: The children , he is present here  [ for them ], and the old men . 

"gloss: children IMPERF-appear-be.at-3.S twelve(?) old.men,

explanation: This sentence consists of five words/morphemes:

1. \"tei'yoonoh'o'\" is correctly glossed as \"children\" (confidence: 0.9)
2. \"nii-\" is the imperfective aspect prefix (IMPERF) (confidence: 0.9)
3. \"-bisi-\" is the verb root meaning \"appear\" (confidence: 0.8)
4. \"-entoo-\" seems to be a locative suffix meaning \"be at\" (confidence: 0.7)
5. \"-t\" is the 3rd person singular suffix (3.S) (confidence: 0.9)
6. \"niiyou\" is likely a number, possibly \"twelve\" (confidence: 0.6)
7. \"beh'eihoho'\" is correctly glossed as \"old.men\" (confidence: 0.8)

The full sentence can be interpreted as \"The children are appearing at/with twelve old men.\"

how RAG was used: The grammar document provided limited direct information for this specific sentence, but it was used in the following ways:

1. The document shows examples of verb conjugations, which helped confirm the use of the imperfective prefix \"nii-\" and the 3rd person singular suffix \"-t\".
2. The document mentions incorporation of nouns into verb forms, which supports the analysis of \"-entoo-\" as a locative suffix.
3. While the exact number \"niiyou\" isn't mentioned, the document includes examples of numbers being used in sentences.
4. The overall structure of the sentence (subject-verb-object) aligns with the patterns seen in the example sentences provided in the document.

The confidence scores reflect the degree of certainty based on direct matches or inferences from the provided grammar context. Lower confidence is assigned to elements not explicitly mentioned or where the interpretation relies more heavily on context or general linguistic knowledge."--------------------------------------------------
